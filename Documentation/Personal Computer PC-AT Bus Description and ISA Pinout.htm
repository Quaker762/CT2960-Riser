      Outs</b></font></a></h3>
<p><b>ISA (AT)bus:</b> The ISA bus operates at 8MHz with an 8 and 16 bits
      data bus, a 24 bit address bus, using +/- 12 volts, +/- 5 volts, and 15
      Interrupt lines. The standard drive level is 24mA for all non
      Open-Collector signals on the bus. The AT card used the standard (edge)
      connector provided by the XT bus and added an additional (edge) connector
      behind that with the same pin-spacing @ 0.1 inch center-to-center. The
      additional connector has only 38 (19 per side) fingers, while the XT
      connector had 62 (32 per side) fingers. The <a href=
      "http://www.interfacebus.com/Mother_Board_Manufacturers.html" title=
      "Mother Board Manufacturers">Motherboard</a> could then accept either an
      8 or 16 bit card in an 8 bit slot (XT), or (if the connector was
      provided) a 16 bit card in an AT slot. A maximum number of 8 Expansion
      slots were provided on IBM compatible Motherboards. The additional
      connector provided 4 additional address lines , and 8 additional data
      lines. Some Interrupt lines are reserved and the AT spec allowed
      interrupt sharing. A number of different oscillators may be used to
      control timers, bus transfers, etc. Refer to this page for a comparison
      of <a href="http://www.interfacebus.com/Video_Bus_Through-put_comparison.html" title=
      "PC Video Bus Expansion Slot Comparison">Video bus through-put</a> for
      different expansion buses. This page provides the <a href=

      <br/>
By 2001, many computers started shipping with <b><a href=
      "http://www.interfacebus.com/Design_Connector_PCI.html" title=
      "Peripheral Component Interface Bus Description, and Pinout, and pinout information">
      PCI</a></b> only slots. But a combination of ISA AT expansion slots, and
      PCI slots was still common. The PC ISA bus is Obsolete and should not be
      used for new designs. In fact, all of the buses listed here are obsolete,
      and were all replaced by the PCI bus. But, because so many ISA cards and
      <a href="http://www.interfacebus.com/Mother_Board_Manufacturers.html"
      title="MotherBoard Manufacturers Listing">Mother boards</a> were produced
      many companies still support these form factors. By the middle of 2004
      many companies were shipping Mother Boards with PCI expansion slots
      [which replaced the ISA slots] and <a href=
      "http://www.interfacebus.com/PCI-Express-Bus-PCIe-Description.html" title=
      "PCIe Bus, Signal names and Pinout"><b>PCI-Express</b></a> slots, in a
      combination of 1x PCIe slots and 16x PCIe slots, which replaced the
      <a href="http://www.interfacebus.com/Design_Connector_AGP.html" title=
      "AGP Bus description, pinout"><b>AGP</b></a> expansion slots. As of 2005
      PCI-express slots reside on a majority of motherboards, but AGP expansion
      slots are still common [especially on AMD based boards]. PCI slots still
      exist on all motherboards, and the ISA expansion slots are all but gone.
      Only industrial PC motherboards still offer ISA based motherboards. In
      addition; the Embedded Industrial <b><a href=
      "http://www.interfacebus.com/Design_Connector_PC104.html" title=
      "PC104 Bus description">PC/104</a></b> specification (IEEE P966) still
      requires the ISA bus, in a different form factor.</p>

<p><b>Additional Personal Computer [PC] Bus Information:</b><br/>
      <b>ISA (XT)bus:</b> Obsolete; 4.77MHz @ 8 bits, +/- 12 volts, +/- 5
      volts. The XT bus used a 62 pin (.1" center) edge connector; 31 pins per
      card side. Used a single oscillator of 14.31818MHz which was divided by
      3. 8 Data lines, 0 to 7 (LSB=0). 20 Address lines, 0 to 19 (LSB=0). 1
      Clock line (4.77MHz). 1 Reset line, 8 Interrupt lines. Some 8 bit cards
      have skirts which extend the board below the depth of the top of the
      connector to allow additional circuitry. These cards, with skirts, are
      not compatible with the 16 bit AT bus. The XT bus uses connector J1
      (A/B), AT uses J1 (A/B), J2 (C/D). A maximum number of 8 Expansion slots
      were provided on IBM compatible Motherboards.<br/>
      <br/>
<b>MCA (Micro Channel Architecture) bus:</b> Obsolete; 10MHz @ 16 or 32
      bits, uP independent, asynchronous, IBM proprietary on PS2 computers.
      With bus enhancements the speed reaches 80MBps, using clock doubling. The
      MCI bus only appeared on IBM PS2 series of computers which have been off
      the market for many years now. MCA description and pinout information is
      listed on the <a href="http://www.interfacebus.com/IBM_MCA_PinOut.html"
      title="MCA Pin Out and Signal names">MCA</a> page.<br/>
      <br/>
<b>EISA (Extended Industry Standard Architecture) or (Enhanced ISA)
      bus:</b> 8MHz @ 8/16/32 bits data bus, 32 bit address bus; PC Expansion
      Bus, compatible with ISA. An ISA card will work in a EISA slot, but an
      EISA card will not work in an AT slot. All of the PC-XT and PC-AT fingers
      reside on an EISA board/connector. The actual EISA fingers (pin) reside
      below the XT and AT fingers on an EISA board. The EISA bus (in one mode)
      used both edges of the clock, with the rising edge used to output
      address, and the falling edge to place the data on the bus. Three other
      transfer modes were available. The EISA bus does not allow the board
      skirts common with the older XT cards. The EISA cards are the same size
      as the AT cards. The new address lines are termed "LA#", all address
      lines are latched. Refer to the <a href=
      "http://www.interfacebus.com/Design_PC_EISA_Card.html" title=
      "EISA Pin Out and Signal names">EISA Pinout</a> table for signal names

<b><a href="http://www.interfacebus.com/Design_Connector_PCI.html" title=
      "PCI Bus">PCI</a></b> (Peripheral Component Interconnect) bus: The
      Peripheral Component Interface 'PCI' [Parallel] Bus was originally
      developed as a local bus expansion for the PC. The first version of the
      PCI bus ran at 33MHz with a 32 bit bus (133MBps), the current version
      runs at 66MHz with a 64 bit bus. The PCI bus operates either
      synchronously or asynchronously with the "mother Board bus rate: The PCI
      bus is microprocessor independent. The page contains the PCI connector
      Pin-Outs. The PCI bus replaced the PCAT bus on most Mother Boards.<br/>
      <br/>
      <b><a href="http://www.interfacebus.com/COTS_PISA_Board_Manufacturers.html" title=
      "PISA Bus Description">PISA</a> (PCI + ISA) bus:</b> ~PC Expansion Bus. A normal ISA card with an
      additional row of pins above, used for the PCI bus. A passive backplane
      which moves all active devices off the Mother-Board and onto a single
      card. The controller card used in the system has fingers [edge
      connectors] for both PCI and the ISA bus, the Mother Board only
      connectors. This allows additional cards to be added to the mother board
      which use either the ISA or PCI buses. Because only connectors reside on
      the motherboard, repair time is increased, and down time is decreased.
      The standard is PICMG-xx. The specification is used in embedded or
      industrial computer systems.<br/>
      <br/>
<b>VESA (Video Electronic Standards Association)/Local bus (<a href=
      "http://www.interfacebus.com/VESA_Local_Bus_Pinout.html" title=
      "VLB pinout and Description">VLB</a> or VL-Bus):</b> had a bus speed of
      33MHz using either 16-bit or 32-bit data transfers, 30 address bits were
      provided. A 64 bit bus was also available by multiplexing the additional
      upper 32 bits on to address bus. A maximum of three devices may be
      connected to the bus. Best speed is seen in the Burst mode: Single
      address followed by 4 data transfers. Supports bus mastering.<br/>
      The <a href="http://www.interfacebus.com/VESA_Local_Bus_Pinout.html"
      title="VLB pinout and Description">VLB</a> resides on a standard 16 bit
      ISA card with the additional pins required by the VLB interface residing
      after the ISA pins, allowing an ISA card to use the same slot. A VLB card
      does not need to use the ISA bus and may only require the VLB connector
      pins. Rev 2 of VLB multiplexed 32 bit of data onto the address bus,
      producing a 64 bit data bus. The version 2 card is back-ware compatible.
      The VLB connector is keyed at pins 46 and 47. The pinout and a short
      description is provided on the <a href=
      "http://www.interfacebus.com/VESA_Local_Bus_Pinout.html" title=
      "VLB pinout and Description">VESA Local Bus</a> page.<br/>
      Because this bus used the same bus structure as the 486, it could only be
      used with the 486 class of processors, with the advent of the Pentium
      <a href="http://www.interfacebus.com/Controllers.html" title=
      "List of Processor Manufacturers">processor</a> and the PCI bus - this
      bus is now obsolete. This bus was replaced with a deviant of the PCI bus
